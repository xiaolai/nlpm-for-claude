# NLPM Quality Scoring Rubric

100-point quality scale for all NL programming artifacts. Apply penalties deterministically. Use calibration examples to anchor judgment on borderline cases.

---

## Scoring Formula

```
base_score = 100
adjustments = sum of all applicable penalties (all penalties are negative)
final_score = max(0, min(100, base_score + adjustments))
```

Penalties stack. The floor is 0; the ceiling is 100. No bonuses — the default assumption is that an artifact is well-formed, and quality is measured by what is missing or wrong.

## Penalty Tables

### Skills

| Rule | Check | Condition | Penalty |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| -- | `name` present | Missing | -25 |
| -- | `name` matches parent directory | Frontmatter `name:` value does not equal parent directory name (per `nlpm:conventions` §5 — open spec MUST) | -15 |
| R04 | `description` present | Missing | -25 |
| R04 | Trigger quality | Description is generic (≤1 specific phrase) | -15 |
| R04 | Description length | Description 500–800 chars | -5 |
| R04 | Description length | Description >800 chars | -10 |
| R05 | Body length | 400–500 lines | -5 |
| R05 | Body length | >500 lines | -10 |
| R06 | Code examples | Complex concepts with no examples | -5 |
| R06 | Code examples | No examples at all in a technical skill | -10 |
| R06 | `<example>` blocks | Zero `<example>` blocks on a `user_invocable: true` skill | -10 |
| R07 | Scope note | No scope note / cross-references | -3 |

> **Scope-note discipline:** R07 means "scope note when related skills exist."
> Do NOT apply R07 to missing example blocks — that is the new R06 row above
> (penalty -10, not -15). The 2026-05-13 lijigang/ljg-skills audit applied
> R07 + −15 fourteen times for missing example blocks; both labels were
> wrong (R07 is not example-related, and -15 is the agents penalty, not
> the skills penalty). The validator at `auditor/scripts/validate-rule-ids.py`
> catches this kind of drift in CI.

> **`<example>`-block counting discipline** (added 2026-08-01, origin:
> xiaolai/cc-suite v1.3.1 remediation): an `<example>` block counts only when
> it sits outside fenced code blocks — in the body or in a frontmatter
> description block scalar. Tags inside a fenced template (` ```markdown … ``` `)
> are illustrative content, and prose that names the string `` `<example>` ``
> is a mention, not a block. A 2026-07-31 scoring pass credited a skill with
> example blocks that existed only inside a fenced template, hiding a real R06
> violation across 13 files. Verify by reading the file, not by grepping for
> the tag.

> **`name` matches parent directory** (added 2026-05-25, audit:
> google/skills): the open Agent Skills spec at agentskills.io makes this
> a MUST. Mismatch is deterministic, high-confidence, and reproducible by
> single-line diff (frontmatter `name:` vs `basename($(dirname FILE))`).
> Mark such findings `confidence: high` per the manifest-vs-disk-diff
> principle in `agents/scorer.md` step 6. Note: this penalty did not
> exist before 2026-05-25 — re-scoring past audits will yield slightly
> lower scores for any corpus containing this defect, but no contribute
> outcomes are retroactively affected since no PRs were ever opened
> against a name-mismatch finding under the prior rubric.

| R27 | Case correct (Codex) | Event name has wrong case | -10 |
| -- | Hooks config key (Codex) | `config.toml` uses deprecated `[features].codex_hooks` instead of `[features].hooks` (renamed ~CLI 0.129+) | -5 (advisory) |

### Hooks (Antigravity / Gemini lineage — Tier 2-Antigravity only) — ADVISORY

Authoritative event list: `nlpm:conventions-antigravity` §5. **All Antigravity-specific hook scoring is advisory-only** (confidence:low) until the Antigravity 2.0 spec stabilizes — see `analysis/multi-tool-design-2026-05.md` decision #3.

| Rule | Check | Condition | Penalty |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| R27 | Event names valid (Gemini lineage) | Uses unrecognized event name — confirmed events: `SessionStart`, `BeforeAgent`, `BeforeModel`, `BeforeToolSelection`, `BeforeTool`, `AfterTool`, `AfterModel`, `AfterAgent`, `SessionEnd`, `Notification`, `PreCompress` | -10 (advisory) |

### Agent Workflow Programs (project-root `program.md`-style files)

A new artifact type recognized 2026-05-28 (see `nlpm:conventions` §2 and `auditor/exemplars/karpathy-autoresearch.md`): a project-root Markdown file driving an autonomous agent loop, hybrid between a memory file (AGENTS.md-shaped context) and a slash command (numbered workflow with output format + error paths).

**No type-specific penalty rows.** This artifact type is scored as the UNION of:
- **Command rules R14–R17**: numbered steps for multi-phase work, empty-input handling, output format, error paths.
- **Memory file rules R33–R39**: build/run commands, architecture overview, no stale refs, instructive-not-descriptive.
- **Universal R01** (vague quantifiers) and R03 (positive framing).

Type-specific penalty rows are deferred until N ≥ 3 examples surface — the existing rules cover the artifact adequately as a hybrid, and inventing rows from N = 1 risks over-fitting (calibrated per the same discipline applied to multi-tool discovery deferrals).

**Patterns this artifact type rewards** (loaded on demand from `nlpm:patterns`):
- P10 (numeric anchoring of subjective principles)
- P11 (paired CAN/CANNOT contract)
- P12 (autonomy instruction + rationale + fallback ladder)
- P13 (vivid closing use-case)

---

### All Artifact Types: Vague Quantifiers

| Rule | Check | Condition | Penalty |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| R01 | Vague quantifier | Each occurrence of: "appropriate", "relevant", "as needed", "sufficient", "adequate", "reasonable", "properly", "correctly", "some", "several", "various" without measurable criteria | -2 each |
| R01 | Vague quantifier cap | Total vague quantifier penalty | max -20 |

> **Mention-versus-use exclusion** (added 2026-08-01, origin: xiaolai/cc-suite
> audit-family false positives; design reviewed via Codex consultation): do not
> count a vague term when it is presented as a literal token AND the containing
> clause explicitly instructs the reader or a tool to detect, flag, reject,
> replace, avoid, or report that term — audit tooling must be able to name the
> words it hunts (e.g. ``Flag uses of `some`, `several`, `various` without
> concrete criteria`` is R01's own job description, not a violation). Backtick
> or quotation formatting alone does NOT qualify: a term that still modifies an
> action, criterion, or requirement is counted even when backticked —
> ``handle errors `properly` `` remains a violation.

---

### All Artifact Types: Vocabulary Drift (R51 — opt-in, disabled by default)

Applied only when `R51: { enabled: true, vocabulary_skill: <path> }` appears in `.claude/nlpm.local.md`. Without the opt-in, R51 contributes zero penalty regardless of artifact content. The configured `vocabulary_skill` must contain a `registry.yaml` listing canonical and deprecated terms; without it, R51 emits an advisory and contributes zero penalty.

| Rule | Check | Condition | Penalty |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| R51 | Deprecated synonym | Each occurrence of a term marked `deprecated:` in the project's `registry.yaml`, in the scope the artifact belongs to | -2 each |
| R51 | Drift cap | Total R51 penalty | max -10 per file |
| R51 | Missing registry | `enabled: true` but `vocabulary_skill:` not set or points to a directory with no `registry.yaml` | 0 (advisory only) |

> **Why opt-in:** vocabulary discipline is high-leverage for projects with accumulated drift but premature for projects still discovering their domain. Each project decides when it has enough literary warrant (P6) to lock terms in. See `analysis/vocabulary-design-principles.md` for the six principles R51 operationalizes.

> **Registry-declaration exclusion** (added 2026-08-01, origin: xiaolai/cc-suite
> vocabulary-skill self-reference; design reviewed via Codex consultation): the
> file that declares a deprecation must name the deprecated term to do so.
> Within the configured `vocabulary_skill` path, do not count a deprecated term
> where it occurs in the declaration that registers it or maps it to its
> replacement — `registry.yaml` `deprecated:` lists and the SKILL.md deprecation
> tables. The exclusion covers ONLY those declaration term fields: deprecated
> terms in surrounding prose inside the `vocabulary_skill` path are counted, and
> the path is not categorically exempt. The same mention-versus-use principle as
> R01's exclusion above, applied to R51.

---

### Cross-Artifact (--plugin flag)

Applied when linting an entire plugin rather than individual files.

| Check | Condition | Penalty |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Broken partial refs | Command references `commands/shared/X.md` that doesn't exist | -20 |
| Broken skill refs | Agent references `plugin:skill` that isn't installed | -20 |
| Missing scripts | Hook references script that doesn't exist | -20 |
| Orphaned files | Agent/command/skill file not referenced by anything | -5 per file |
| Contradictions | Two rules/instructions in same plugin directly contradict each other | -15 per pair |

---

## Score Bands

| Range | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90–100 | Excellent | Production-ready; minor or no findings |
| 80–89 | Good | Solid; one or two non-critical gaps |
| 70–79 | Adequate | Meets threshold; noticeable gaps to address |
| 60–69 | Weak | Below threshold; significant findings |
| <60 | Rewrite | Fundamental problems; recommend rewriting from scratch |

**Default pass threshold:** 70. Configurable in `.claude/nlpm.local.md`.

---

## Calibration Examples

Four worked examples — *Excellent Agent (95)*, *Rewrite Agent (41)*, *Excellent Rule (92)*, *Weak Rule (40)* — live in [`references/calibration-examples.md`](references/calibration-examples.md). Load that file on demand when scoring a borderline case (around band boundaries: 88-92, 68-72, 58-62) and you need an anchored reference.

The examples are not needed for routine scoring — the penalty tables above are self-contained. They were extracted from this file 2026-05-28 to keep the rubric under R05's 500-line body budget while preserving the calibration material verbatim.

---

## Scope Note

This skill covers the NLPM scoring formula, penalty tables, score bands, and calibration examples. It does NOT cover:
- Artifact schemas and valid field values → see `nlpm:conventions` (universal) and the tool-specific overlays `nlpm:conventions-claude`, `nlpm:conventions-codex`, `nlpm:conventions-antigravity` (the latter three created in PR-B; see `analysis/multi-tool-design-2026-05.md`)
- Patterns and anti-patterns catalog → see `nlpm:patterns`
- How to run the score command → see `commands/score.md`

### Multi-tool scoring (PR-B landed 2026-05-25)

nlpm now scores artifacts across three tool ecosystems — Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity (which absorbs Gemini CLI on 2026-06-18). The tier classification in `agents/scorer.md` separates open-spec (Tier 1), Tier 1.5 open-spec corpora, and per-tool Tier 2 overlays (2-Claude / 2-Codex / 2-Antigravity).

- **Hooks** are scored per tool (Claude / Codex / Antigravity tables above). The three tools' event vocabularies are not 1:1 mappable; no universal translation layer. See `analysis/multi-tool-design-2026-05.md` decision #4.
- **Codex-specific artifacts** scored: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `agents/openai.yaml` sidecars.
- **Antigravity-specific artifacts** scored (advisory-only until spec stabilizes): `gemini-extension.json`, `.gemini/commands/*.toml`, Antigravity hook events.
- **Claude-specific additions** in 2026: `.lsp.json`, `monitors/monitors.json` (validate JSON-parse only until detailed schemas land). New SKILL.md fields documented in `nlpm:conventions-claude`.

### Known False Positive Patterns

The following findings have historically been reported by the scorer despite
having no backing in this rubric. They MUST NOT be penalized:

| Invalid finding | Why it is invalid |
|---|---|
| Missing `namespace:` on skill | Not in the skill schema; `conventions` §5 does not list it |
| Missing inline `hooks:`/`skills:` registration blocks in plugin.json | `conventions` §1 defines these as optional path strings |
| `AskUserQuestion` / `Task` / `WebFetch` flagged as undocumented tool | Built-in per `conventions` §14 |
| Agent missing `skills:` when omission is documented in CLAUDE.md | Intentional architectural choice |
| plugin.json missing `engines:` / `minClaudeVersion:` / `main:` | All optional per `conventions` §1 |
| plugin.json description shorter than sibling marketplace.json description | Desynchronization ≠ defect; only penalize if required field is absent |

When in doubt: if a finding cannot be cited to a specific row in the penalty
tables above, drop it.
