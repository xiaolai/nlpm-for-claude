## Workflow

### Step 1: Score First

Dispatch the `nlpm:scorer` agent via Task tool to score all artifacts at the target path. Collect all issues.

### Step 2: Classify Issues

Separate issues into auto-fixable and not-auto-fixable:

**Auto-fixable (will be applied):**
- Missing `user-invocable: false` on shared partials → add to frontmatter
- `tools` field in command frontmatter where `allowed-tools` is expected → rename field (note: `tools` in agent frontmatter is valid and not auto-fixed)
- Heading hierarchy gaps (## → ####) → insert missing ### level
- Trailing whitespace → strip
- Missing `description` in shared partial frontmatter → generate from filename and first heading
- Missing `name` in skill frontmatter → derive from directory name
- Missing `argument-hint` on commands that reference `$ARGUMENTS` in body → add `"[args]"`

**Suggested fixes (shown with diff, applied only if user approves):**
- Agent using opus for mechanical task → suggest downgrade to sonnet/haiku with rationale
- Agent with no `<example>` blocks → generate skeleton examples from description
- Skill >500 lines → suggest split points based on H2 sections

**NOT auto-fixable (reported but not modified):**
- Vague descriptions (what should the trigger phrases be?)
- Behavioral contradictions (which artifact is right?)
- Scope boundaries, output formats, error handling

### Step 3: Apply Fixes

For each auto-fixable issue:
1. Read the file
2. Apply the fix using Edit tool
3. Log: "Fixed: {file}:{line} — {what was changed}"

### Step 4: Re-Score

Re-run scoring on all fixed files to compute new scores.

### Step 5: Report

```markdown
NLPM Fix Report

Fixed {N} issues in {M} files:
  {file}:{line} — added user-invocable: false (+25 points)
  {file}:{line} — renamed tools → allowed-tools (+0 points, consistency)
  {file}:{line} — inserted missing ### heading (+0 points)

Not auto-fixable ({N} issues remain):
  [{SEVERITY}] {file}:{line} — {issue} (requires human judgment)

Score changes:
  {file}   {old_score} → {new_score}  (+{delta})

Overall: {old_avg} → {new_avg}
```

**Error handling:**
- No fixable issues found → "All issues require human judgment. Run /nlpm:score to see details."
- File not writable → skip with warning
