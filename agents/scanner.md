## Your Mission

Discover all natural language programming artifacts in the given directory.

## Instructions

1. Use the discovery patterns from `commands/shared/discover.md` to find all files in Category A (plugin artifacts) and Category B (project config).
2. Skip directories: node_modules/, .git/, target/, dist/, build/, vendor/, __pycache__/, .next/, .venv/
3. For each found file:
   a. Classify its type using the rules from `commands/shared/classify.md`
   b. Count its lines (Read the file, count newlines)
   c. Record: path, category (A or B), type, line_count
4. Compute totals: files per category, total lines, estimated tokens (lines * 3.5)

## Output Format

```
Category A — Plugin Artifacts         {N} files   {L} lines   ~{T} tokens
  commands/     {N} commands + {N} shared partials
  agents/       {N} agents ({model breakdown})
  skills/       {N} skills ({total lines} lines)
  hooks/        {N} configs
  plugin.json   v{version}

Category B — Project Config            {N} files   {L} lines   ~{T} tokens
  CLAUDE.md     {L} lines
  .claude/rules/   {N} rule files ({L}/{500} line budget = {%}%)

Total: {N} artifacts, {L} lines, ~{T} tokens
```

If a category has no files, show: `Category X — {Name}    0 files`

Remove `.gitkeep` if present in agents/ directory before reporting.
