# Writing Skills

> Scope: covers SKILL.md authoring. For agent writing, see [[writing-agents]]. For plugin architecture, see [[writing-plugins]].

## 1. The Description is Everything

The `description` field determines when Claude loads this skill. It is not a summary -- it is a **trigger mechanism**.

**Bad** (score 55):
```yaml
description: "Helpful skill for React development"
```

**Good** (score 95):
```yaml
description: "Use when building React components, debugging re-renders, optimizing performance with useMemo/useCallback, or fixing hook dependency arrays"
```

### Description Checklist

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| 3+ trigger phrases | Count distinct action phrases separated by commas |
| Action-oriented | Starts with "Use when..." or "How to..." |
| Includes tool/framework name | The technology name appears explicitly |
| Matches real queries | Would a user's actual question contain any of your trigger words? |

### Trigger Phrase Construction

Map real user queries to trigger phrases:

| User says | Trigger phrase to include |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| "My component re-renders too much" | "debugging re-renders" |
| "How do I memoize this?" | "optimizing performance with useMemo/useCallback" |
| "My useEffect runs in a loop" | "fixing hook dependency arrays" |
| "I need a new component for..." | "building React components" |

**Rule**: if you can't list 3 real user queries that match your description, rewrite it.

## 2. Body Structure

### Section Order

1. **Scope note** (if related skills exist) -- tells Claude when to use THIS skill vs another
2. **Most commonly needed patterns** -- what users ask about 80% of the time
3. **Decision matrices** -- when to use A vs B (tables)
4. **Worked examples** -- before/after with scores
5. **Common mistakes** -- anti-patterns to avoid
6. **References** -- links to deep dives

### Heading Rules

- H1 (`#`): skill title only (one per file)
- H2 (`##`): major sections (numbered: `## 1. Section Name`)
- H3 (`###`): subsections within a major section
- Never skip heading levels (no H2 followed directly by H4)

### Code Examples

Every code example must show the **problem**, then the **solution**:

```markdown
### Bad (breaks on concurrent requests)
` ` `python
global_state = {}  # shared mutable state
` ` `

### Good (request-scoped)
` ` `python
def handler(request):
    state = {}  # local to this request
` ` `
```

**Rules for code examples:**
- Runnable, not pseudocode
- Contextual -- show enough surrounding code to understand placement
- Annotated -- comment the critical line, not every line

## 3. Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Use the file system for depth:

```
skills/my-domain/my-skill/
  SKILL.md          # core patterns (< 500 lines)
  references/       # deep dives, edge cases, full API docs
    advanced.md
    api-reference.md
  examples/         # working code samples
    basic-setup.ts
    advanced-config.ts
  scripts/          # utility scripts
    validate.sh
```

### When to Extract to references/

| Content type | Keep in SKILL.md? | Extract to references/? |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Top 5 patterns everyone needs | Yes | No |
| Full API reference (50+ entries) | No | Yes |
| Edge cases (< 5% of users) | No | Yes |
| Configuration matrix (20+ options) | No | Yes |
| Quick decision table (< 10 rows) | Yes | No |

## 4. Worked Example: Improving a Skill

### Before (score 55/100)

```yaml
---
name: docker-helper
description: "Information about Docker"
version: 0.1.0
---
```

```markdown
# Docker Helper

Docker is a containerization platform. Here are some useful commands.

## Commands
- `docker build` - builds an image
- `docker run` - runs a container
- `docker ps` - lists containers

## Dockerfile
A Dockerfile contains instructions for building an image.

## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is for multi-container applications.
```

**Problems:**
- Description is a label, not a trigger mechanism (0 trigger phrases)
- Body teaches theory Claude already knows from training
- No code examples showing problem/solution
- No decision matrices
- No scope note

### After (score 92/100)

```yaml
---
name: docker-helper
description: "Use when writing Dockerfiles, debugging container networking, optimizing image size with multi-stage builds, or configuring Docker Compose services. Covers build cache, volume mounts, health checks, and compose profiles."
version: 0.1.0
---
```

```markdown
# Docker Helper

> Scope: covers Docker CLI, Dockerfiles, and Compose. For Kubernetes deployment, see [[k8s-deploy]].

## 1. Image Size Optimization

### Before (1.2 GB)
` ` `dockerfile
FROM node:20
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
` ` `

### After (148 MB -- 88% smaller)
` ` `dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
` ` `

Key changes: multi-stage build, slim base, copy only production artifacts.

## 2. Base Image Selection

| Use case | Base image | Size |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Node.js production | node:20-slim | 180 MB |
| Node.js minimal | node:20-alpine | 130 MB |
| Python production | python:3.12-slim | 150 MB |
| Static files only | nginx:alpine | 40 MB |
| From scratch (Go/Rust) | scratch | < 20 MB |
```

**Changes made:**
1. Description: 0 trigger phrases -> 8 trigger phrases (+37 points)
2. Scope note added (+5 points)
3. Replaced theory with problem/solution examples (+25 points)
4. Added decision matrix (+10 points)
5. Removed content Claude knows from training (-15 lines, +5 points for conciseness)

## 5. Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Description is a feature list | Claude can't match user queries to the skill | Rewrite as trigger phrases starting with "Use when..." |
| Body teaches theory | Wastes tokens on content Claude already knows | Show patterns and decisions, not definitions |
| Over 500 lines | Bloats context window, penalized by linters | Extract to references/, keep core patterns only |
| No scope note | Claude doesn't know when to use THIS skill vs a related one | Add scope note referencing related skills |
| Pseudocode examples | Not actionable, can't be copy-pasted | Use runnable code with enough context |
| Every section has equal weight | Buries the most useful content | Lead with the 80% patterns, push edge cases to references/ |
